                    Despite the significant technological advancements which have been introduced in the consumer
                    sales sector, the Business-to-Business (B2B) sector has lagged behind in adopting new technologies. 
                    This has resulted in the majority of these processes being slow and reliant on human expertise. 
                    This paper examines the implementation of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the efficiency and
                    quality of matching Request for Quotations with suitable suppliers in a B2B supply chain procurement
                    platform. By leveraging LLM vector embeddings and similarity metrics such as cosine similarity,
                    we significantly improve the efficiency of the entity matching processes taking place in these
                    procurement platforms. Through comprehensive experimentation, with the use of various models and
                    approaches, we demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMs within the domain. We develop a system
                    capable of matching RFQs to appropriate suppliers within seconds from a pool of hundreds of
                    companies. With the top-performing model, on average ranking the correct supplier as the
                    second most probable and achieving a success rate of 47.9% in identifying the supplier
                    selected by a procurement agent, we clearly demonstrate the real-world suitability of
                    LLMs to this task. Furthermore, we provide a comparison of the use of open versus closed
                    source LLMs and assess the advantages and disadvantages that such models present.
                    Overall, this paper provides an in-depth analysis of the successful integration of LLMs
                    into the procurement sector, providing insights into improving the efficiency and quality
                    of B2B supply chain procurement platforms.
